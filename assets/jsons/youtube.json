I did my undergrad at BYU and Masters at USC.\n2) I worked for NASA JPL for 9 years, 7 of which were working on the Curiosity Rover (I made a video about it you should def totes watch cause it's probably my favorite of all my videos).  I founded a company called Digital Dudz on my nights and weekends while working at NASA (also made some videos about that) and sold it to the guys who make Morphsuits in the UK.  As part of the sale I quit my job at NASA and worked for them coming up with all their new costume ideas for 2 years.  Recently, I was presented with an opportunity to return to my Engineering roots to come do some ideation type of work for a tech company near San Francisco.   \n3) Link to free and therefore substandard build plans for my custom workbench can be found below."
